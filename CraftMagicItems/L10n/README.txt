If you want, you can take the data in Strings_enGB.json and create files for other locales.  They will be automatically
picked up by the mod on startup if they match your assigned locale.

The file names should be:

Strings_deDE.json
Strings_enGB.json
Strings_frFR.json
Strings_ruRU.json
Strings_zhCN.json
